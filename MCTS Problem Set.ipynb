    "# Monte Carlo Tree Search Mini Problem Set\n",

    "Welcome to Starfleet Academy! You are headed to your first class in Game Tactics, a necessary prerequisite if you want to qualify for the officer training track. The teacher of Game Tactics is Stonn, a notoriously xenophobic Vulcan who has never forgotten his humiliation at the hands of a human and a halfbreed. His prejudice is the only obstacle between you and the yellow uniform, but as long as you keep your head down it should only be a minor ordeal. You enter the classroom, seeing students putting away their books and a clock that reads 10:00. Daylight savings time has struck again!\n",

    "## But what is a tree search?\n",
    "Trees are a special case of the graph problems previously seen in class. For example, consider Tic Tac Toe. From the starting blank board, each choice of where to draw an X is a possible future, followed by each choice of where to draw an O. A planner can look at this sprawl of futures and choose which action will most likely lead to victory.\n",

    "## Breadth First Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In a breadth first tree search the planner considers potential boards in order of depth. All boards that are one turn in the future are considered first, followed by the boards two turns away, until every potential board has been considered. The planner then chooses the best move to make based on whether the move will lead to victory or to defeat. In the following example, a breadth first search would identify that all other moves lead to a loss and instead pick the rightmost move.\n",

    "## Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with breadth first search is that it isn't at all clever. Tic Tac Toe is one of the simpler games in existence, but there are nearly three-hundred sixty thousand possible sets of moves for a BFS-based planner to consider. In a game with less constrained movement, like chess, this number exceeds the number of atoms in the known universe after looking only a couple of turns into the future. A Breadth First Search is too tied up with being logical and provably correct. Monte Carlo Tree Search leaps ahead to impulsively go where no search has gone before. In simpler terms, BFS is Spock while MCTS is Kirk.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS performs its search by repeatedly imagining play-throughs of the game or scenario, traveling down the entire branch of the game tree until it terminates. Based on how this play-through went, MCTS then updates the value of each node (move) involved based on whether it won or lost the playthrough. The Monte Carlo component comes from the fact that it chooses moves at random, not based on heuristics or visit count. This nondeterminism greatly increases the potential space it can explore even though its exploration will be much less rigorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's look at the BFS tree above. The bad red moves have a high probability of loss because in 1/5 of the playthroughs X will instantly win. The correct, rightmost move will have a lower probability of a loss because X doesn't have this 1/5 chance of winning. MCTS will discard the red moves because of this higher loss probability, assigning them lower values whenever it selects them during a randomized play-through.\n",
